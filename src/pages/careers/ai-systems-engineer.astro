          About the Role
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-100">
          We're looking for a senior engineer to co-lead our research and
          implementation efforts on applying LLMs and other ML techniques to
          reason about software security. You'll play a critical role in shaping
          not just the product, but also our technical direction, engineering
          culture, and team.
          <br />
          We value strong judgment and principled thinkingâ€”you'll have the autonomy
          to challenge assumptions, explore unconventional ideas, and chart the right
          course between rigor and speed. This role is about navigating ambiguity,
          making deliberate trade-offs, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible
          in automated security reasoning.

          <li>
            <strong>High-level security reasoning</strong>: Build systems that
            analyze architecture and posture to infer risks and generate
            security requirements and recommendations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tactical security reasoning</strong>: Analyze product specs
            and task descriptions to generate concrete security requirements
            before code is written.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Security pattern enforcement</strong>: Leverage
            organizational and codebase context to identify, codify, and enforce
            security best practices across the SDLC.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Toolchain integration</strong>: Connect with tools like
            Google Docs, Confluence, Jira, and GitHub to ingest development
            artifacts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>LLM & model engineering</strong>: Fine-tune, benchmark, and
            optimize LLMs and ML models for security-specific reasoning tasks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scalability & performance</strong>: Design AI systems to
            efficiently process large-scale codebases and documentation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Modern engineering practices</strong>: Use infrastructure as
            code, write robust tests, follow CI/CD workflows, and collaborate in
            a Kanban process.
