          DevArmor is looking for its first design hire, a hands-on Product
          Designer who’s excited to shape how security teams interact with
          AI-native tools. You’ll work side-by-side with product, engineering,
          and AI teams to turn complex security concepts into intuitive, elegant
          workflows for developers and security engineers.
          <br />
          This is a high-ownership role where you’ll define our design direction,
          lead research and prototyping, and help set the foundation for design at
          DevArmor. If you’ve worked on SaaS products, especially for enterprise
          users, and enjoy solving tough UX problems with clarity and structure,
          this role is for you.
