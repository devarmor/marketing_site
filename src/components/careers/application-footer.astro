        About DevArmor
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-100">
        DevArmor is a venture-backed, early-stage startup founded by repeat
        entrepreneurs and security veterans. Our founders have successfully
        started and sold security startups. We are backed by tier-1 investors,
        and our team of advisors include executives from Sierra.ai, Databricks,
        Netflix, Mozilla, Semgrep. Here is how an executive at Okta describes
        this opportunity:
        <blockquote
          class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-100">
          "DevArmor is redefining how we build secure software. Instead of
          treating security as an afterthought, their platform bakes it into the
          earliest design decisions. That vision — security by design at scale —
          is exactly what our industry needs to finally get ahead of attackers.
          The team is stellar and brings a wealth of experience and developer
          empathy to the problem. I am thrilled to be an investor and partner
          with them in the journey in making security more than just a checkbox
          and empower developers to build secure software from day one."
