title: "Automated Threat Modeling Manifesto"
snippet: "Despite modern AppSec tools promising automated vulnerability management, security engineers still rely on manual code review to identify a significant share of vulnerabilities. Logical flaws that are caused by incorrect reasoning about design decisions or business logic or wrong assumptions about other components, microservices, or internal libraries. Identifying these “logical flaws” requires a logical understanding of the code beyond the syntactic and semantic knowledge, as well as a contextual understanding of security threats and business risks. Design-first and threat-model-based workflows powered by AI can help identify these logical flaws automatically."
